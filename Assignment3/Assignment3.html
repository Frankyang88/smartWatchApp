        <h1>About the App</h1>
        
        <h2>About the Emulator</h2>
             
        <p>One of the ways, the Travel App processes information is by using Google Maps API provided by the Emulator.
            For example, when a user asks for a radar search within 5 km, the emulator will pass this information to the
            App. Once the Travel App receives this information, it can then access its database and sort the locations
            based on calculated distances between current location and destinations using functions from the emulator.
            The sorted locations are then passed back to the emulator for display to the user as a list. </p>
        <p>The emulator also calculates the distance between point A to point B. For example, if a user is located in
            Owheo and wants to reach New Worlds Gardens, a function located in the emulator wiould be called to calculate
            this distance. This function came from the Google Maps API and receives input in the form of longtitude and
            latitude. </p>

        <h2>About the Travel App</h2>
        <p>We could not get the geolocation service to run properly in every browser. Therefore, the Travel App was hard
            coded the current location to be in Owheo Building. In the next phase of development, we plan to properly
            research and implement the geolocation service to run in every browser so we do not hard-code the locations.</p>

        <p> Each radar search would result in the places close to the university in the range of 1 km, 5km and 20km. The
            user would be able to filter the results returned by the app through choosing from a set category of places
            to choose from. For example, at the moment the user can choose between accomodation, public facilities and
            entertainment to choose from. </p>

        <p>At the moment, our prototype can only display a list of locations to the user after the user has chosen their
            filter. We plan to provide more information about locations such as place description, opening hours, time
            taken to get there and an image of the place once the user has clicked on the location. </p>

    <div id="experience_in_development">

        <h1>Experience in developing the Travel App</h1>
        <p> In our prototype, we are faced with many problems that the emulator knows the name of our app and contains some               application specific functions. In the current version, such methods and data have been moved to our app. 
            In addition, unused methods are dropped. Our new emulator provides all the necessary API that helps to layout 
            our app on the canvas.</p>
        <p>The scale of this project was too small to implement MongoDB to store locations. Also, we would need a server
            to access and change the MongoDB. However due to our current understanding of the assignment requirements,
            we were limited to using Javascript. Once we realized that we could not use MongoDB, we tried using an XML
            file as a database. However it requires a server-side script to save changes to an XML file. We then settled
            on using a simple Javascript file to store location names, geolocation information and location addresses.
            We used Google maps API to initialize our database. In theory, our database will be separate from Google
            Maps database. The advantages of doing so, would mean that if we ever commercialize our app, we could insert
            unique or private locations which businesses have paid for. This would also differentiate our Travel app
            from competitors if we had locations in our database that was not present in others. </p>
        <p>The final step of our Travel App would allow users to pick a location. Then, the travel app would provide a
            detailed description and images of the chosen location. Due to time constraints, we could not implement this
            final step. </p>
        <p>The emulator Javascript file also has a lot of unused google maps API functions. In the process of developing
            the Travel App, we realized that Chrome and Safari could not support geolocation services. Also, some of the
            google maps API functions were included because we thought that it would provide some use for us. However,
            as more research and testing went on, we ended up using only the radar search and a function called
            computeDistanceBetween using the geometry library. </p>
        <p>We tried to impelmenting the swipe and drag functionality. For example:</p>
        <p>The user can click and drag to the right anywhere in the emulator for the google map to appear. This action
            represents a swipe right action as if it were a real smartwatch with swipe functionality. The user can exit
            google maps by clicking quit maps. </p>

        <p>The user can also click and drag left for a clock to appear. This action represents a swipe left action. The
            user can exit out of the clock by dragging down and come back to the home page. </p>
        <p>Due to time constraint, we decided to remove these functionality, however we might continue to work on that in
            our next developing phase.</p>
        <p>We underestimated the time taken to design the app and emulator, and how they would interact with each other.
            Therefore we ran out of time to implement more function in the emulator and app. In next assignment, we will
            allocate more time to design the app and emulator. Having a good design would improve communication within
            the group. </p>

    <div id="unit_tests">

        <h1>Unit Tests </h1>

        <p>We have implemented 28 testcases, which include eventlisteners, emulator api test and application-related
            functions. <a href="testcase/test.html">QUnit testing </a> can report error when the test case fails. 
            All the test cases can pass in Chrome and FireFox. One case fails in Internet Explorer 8, which is a quite
            old browser. 
        </p>
        <p>UI test is a quite hard work. As the "button" drawn on the canvas is made of pixels, there is no objects there.
           Some established test methods requires comparison between two pictures, comparing the value of every pixel on
            the canvas with another image. When the pictures are painted, we have no reference image at all. 
        </p>
    </div>

    <div id="group_issue">

        <h1> Group Issue</h1>

        <p> It is important to have weekly meetings with the whole group because the emulator and the app overlap so we
            need everyone to be at meetings. </p>
