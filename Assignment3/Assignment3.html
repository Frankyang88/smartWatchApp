        <h1>Emulator Structure and Function</h1>
        <h2>User input and events</h2>
        <p>
            The emulator provides a user input service to the app. This is done by passing  a callback function from the app to the emulator at the setup. When a mouse event occurs, the emulator then use the callback function to pass the mouse event as an object back to the app. 
The app will describe what to do for input (a mouse event in the browser. For example, when a user ‘presses’ a button on the screen, swipes to the right, left and right.  The emulator interpret this as a click  and a click and drag event. 
The emulator initializes a mouseEvent object. This object has the following attributes - one that tracks the state of a mouse click event (stored as a 0 or 1), where exactly the user has clicked (stored as x and y coordinates) and also a variable that tracks and saves the state of a click and drag event (stored as canY and canX). It can use these to specify what to display when a user event has occurred without the app knowing that the user event was a click from the browser.

        <h1>Experience in developing the Travel App</h1>
        <p> In our prototype, we are faced with many problems that the emulator knows the name of our app and contains some               application specific functions. In the current version, such methods and data have been moved to our app. 
            In addition, unused methods are dropped. Our new emulator provides all the necessary API that helps to layout 
            our app on the canvas.</p>
     </div>

    <div id="unit_tests">

        <h1>Unit Tests </h1>

        <p>We have implemented 28 testcases, which include eventlisteners, emulator api test and application-related
            functions. <a href="testcase/test.html">QUnit testing </a> can report error when the test case fails. 
            All the test cases can pass in Chrome and FireFox. One case fails in Internet Explorer 8, which is a quite
            old browser. 
        </p>
        <p>UI test is a quite hard work. As the "button" drawn on the canvas is made of pixels, there is no objects there.
           Some established test methods requires comparison between two pictures, comparing the value of every pixel on
            the canvas with another image. When the pictures are painted, we have no reference image at all. 
        </p>
    </div>

    <div id="group_issue">

        <h1> Group Issue</h1>

        <p> It is important to have weekly meetings with the whole group because the emulator and the app overlap so we
            need everyone to be at meetings. </p>
