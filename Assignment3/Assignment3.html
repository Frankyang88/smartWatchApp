        <h1>Experience in developing the Travel App</h1>
        <p> In our prototype, we are faced with many problems that the emulator knows the name of our app and contains some               application specific functions. In the current version, such methods and data have been moved to our app. 
            In addition, unused methods are dropped. Our new emulator provides all the necessary API that helps to layout 
            our app on the canvas.</p>
     </div>

    <div id="unit_tests">

        <h1>Unit Tests </h1>

        <p>We have implemented 28 testcases, which include eventlisteners, emulator api test and application-related
            functions. <a href="testcase/test.html">QUnit testing </a> can report error when the test case fails. 
            All the test cases can pass in Chrome and FireFox. One case fails in Internet Explorer 8, which is a quite
            old browser. 
        </p>
        <p>UI test is a quite hard work. As the "button" drawn on the canvas is made of pixels, there is no objects there.
           Some established test methods requires comparison between two pictures, comparing the value of every pixel on
            the canvas with another image. When the pictures are painted, we have no reference image at all. 
        </p>
    </div>

    <div id="group_issue">

        <h1> Group Issue</h1>

        <p> It is important to have weekly meetings with the whole group because the emulator and the app overlap so we
            need everyone to be at meetings. </p>
